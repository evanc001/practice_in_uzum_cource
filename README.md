Worked with a tutor on warehouse order analysis, focusing on order volume and assembly time over three sessions

# Warehouse Order Analysis

This repository contains work done in collaboration with a tutor to analyze warehouse orders and processing times.

## Overview

The project spans three sessions where we focused on:

- Analyzing order volumes
- Studying assembly times in the warehouse
- Utilizing linear models and KMeans clustering for analysis

## Tools Used

- Python for data analysis
- Jupyter Notebooks for code execution
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for implementing linear models and KMeans clustering

## File Structure

- `Step_updates.ipynb`: Contains analysis for the first session
- `live_code_project.ipynb`: Analysis for the second session (includes live coding)
- `session_3.ipynb`: Analysis for the third session (upcoming)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_URL>`
2. Open Jupyter Notebook and explore the sessions

Feel free to reach out for any questions or suggestions!
